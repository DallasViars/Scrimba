Things to do:
    <!-- 1. When adding movie to watchlist shade the background to show that it's been added
    1a. Possibly change the "+ Watchlist" text to "Added to watchlist"
        //Scrapped, didn't look right -->

2. Save search results to localstorage so they can be loaded if switching back and forth b/t the Search and Watchlist pages
    //Delayed until later

3. Make a clear search results button
    //Delayed until after #2

4. Make a "Your watchlist is looking a little empty" div on the watchlist linking back to the search page

5. Sort search entries so they are always in the same order?

    <!-- 6.  Add two <span>s to the watchlist link, one for plus, one for minus
    6a.  Make .toggle-add and .toggle-remove classes to change the span -->
